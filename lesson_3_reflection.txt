When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when working with someone else or working on different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	maybe i'm not done working on a new feature or fixing a bug, I would not want to pull inclomplete code that doesn't make sense
