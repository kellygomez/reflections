When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when working with someone else or working on different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	maybe i'm not done working on a new feature or fixing a bug, I would not want to pull inclomplete code that doesn't make sense

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks is when i clone a repository from another github account into my github account, and it indicates the original owner of the repository, clones are made from a github account to a local computer or in the same local computer, branches ar done in the same repository to introduce changes but we don't want to affect the master branch
